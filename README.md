## Purpose of this doc
<a name="purpose"></a><a name="1.1"></a>
This doc intends to codify some guiding principles of writing code which are not easily detected or enforced by a linter. As there are already many great styleguides in circulation, this is meant to augment those rather than creating another exhaustive list.

## Intended audience
<a name="audience"></a><a name="1.2"></a>
The intended audience for this doc is coders, collaborators and teams. The primary target language is JS/ES/TS but the concepts can apply to other languages.

## Principles
*Create code with clarity and empathy in mind*

* Favor code clarity over terseness.
* Consistency over cleverness.
* Code is both a document of what is intended to be executed as well as an instruction set to execute a task
* Be empathetic to your colleagues
* Your future self is a colleague!
